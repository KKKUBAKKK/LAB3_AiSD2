This task involves solving several graph-related problems. The first part requires creating the square of a graph, where vertices are connected if they are either directly connected or connected through a two-edge path. The second part involves constructing an edge graph, where vertices represent the original graph's edges and are connected if they share a common vertex. The third part is about finding a proper vertex coloring of an undirected graph using a greedy algorithm. The fourth part extends this by finding a strong edge coloring, utilizing the results from the previous tasks.
